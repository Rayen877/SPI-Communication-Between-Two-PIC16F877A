# SPI-Communication-Between-Two-PIC16F877A
This project demonstrates how to implement SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication between two PIC16F877A microcontrollers.
The setup includes one PIC configured as Master and the other as Slave, exchanging data over the SPI bus.
The firmware is developed using MPLAB X IDE with the XC8 compiler, and the whole system is simulated in Proteus.
